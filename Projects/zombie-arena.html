            <h1>Zombie arena</h1>

            <p>For the second project I decided to create something more active. During creation I used more game object
                components. Also, I worked a bit with animations and created simple UI.
            </p>

            <p><span>Difficulties:</span> One difficulty was that at first I used MoveTowards() method to make zombies
                follow the player. That caused them to push the player through walls from time to time. I coped with
                that by calculating vectors and modifying zombies' velocity instead of changing their transform
                component directly (what MoveTowards() did). That would also make zombies slide away if the player had
                bumped into them. At first, I didn't like that effect, but after modifying zombies' mass, it looked
                like a cool "push away" mechanics.</p>
