            <h1>Battleships</h1>

            <p>"Battleships" is my recreation of popular pencil-and-paper game in Unity. It is quite
                uncomplicated, so I thought that would be the best option to get familiar with the game engine.
            </p>

            <p><span>Difficulties:</span> Despite the simplicity of the game, there were some problems. For example, I
                had difficulty with letting a player place ships. Another problem was to make the opponent-bot finish
                already damaged ships.
            </p>
            <p>These difficulties were solved due to the fact that the map consists of tiles which are stored in the
                array. Thanks to it, before placing a ship, it's being checked via script whether the tile is empty and
                is not next to already placed ships. Also, when the bot hits the target, script checks all array values
                in all directions from that tile and blocks a direction if there is an obstacle.</p>
